In your PathSense-Agents directory, create a file named `.env`:

```bash
cd /Users/ronakmalkan/code/PathSense-Agents
touch .env
```

### 2.2 Add Your Credentials

Open `.env` and add your Twilio credentials:

```env
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+15551234567
```

**Replace with your actual values:**

TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1XXXXXXXXXX
```

### 2.3 Verify .env File

Make sure:
- ‚úÖ File is named exactly `.env` (with the dot)

## Step 3: Verify Emergency Contact Phone

### 3.1 Check Trial Account Restrictions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Twilio trial accounts can only send SMS to verified phone numbers.**

1. Go to **Twilio Console** ‚Üí **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Manage** ‚Üí **Verified Caller IDs**
2. Click **Add a new number**
3. Enter the emergency contact phone number (e.g., `+14085693812`)
4. Twilio will call/text that number with a verification code
5. Enter the code to verify

**Once verified, you can send SMS to that number!**

### 3.2 Upgrade to Remove Restrictions (Optional)

To send SMS to any number without verification:
1. Go to **Billing** in Twilio Console
2. Add credit card and upgrade account
3. Now you can send to any phone number

---

## Step 4: Test SMS Integration

### 4.1 Restart the Server

Stop your PathSense server (Ctrl+C) and restart it:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see the server start normally. The `.env` file is loaded automatically.

### 4.2 Trigger a Test Alert

**Option A: Use Your Android App**

Navigate in a way that triggers a stuck scenario:
- Send only `STOP` or `CAUTION` events (no `CLEAR`) for 100+ seconds

**Option B: Send Test Logs via API**

```bash
# Send 40 STOP events (will trigger stuck alert)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ingest/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "logs": [
      {"client_id": "test123", "session_id": "session1", "t": '$(date +%s)', "events": ["STOP"], "classes": ["car"], "confidence": 0.8},
      {"client_id": "test123", "session_id": "session1", "t": '$(($(date +%s) + 3))', "events": ["STOP"], "classes": ["car"], "confidence": 0.8},
      ...
    ]
  }'
```

### 4.3 Check Server Console

You should see:

```
[WATCHDOG] üö® Stuck alert sent for test123: 105s with no CLEAR events
[ALERT] ‚úÖ SMS sent to +14085693812
[ALERT] Message SID: SMxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
[ALERT] Status: queued
```

### 4.4 Check Your Phone

Within a few seconds, you should receive an SMS like:

```
üö® PathSense ALERT

User unable to proceed for 105 seconds. Repeated obstacles with no clear path.

Time: 01:30 PM

Please check on the user immediately.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Twilio credentials not configured"

**Cause:** `.env` file not found or variables not set correctly

**Fix:**
1. Verify `.env` file exists in the correct location
2. Check variable names are exactly: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
3. No quotes around values in `.env`
4. Restart the server after creating/editing `.env`

### Issue: "The number +1XXXXXXXXXX is unverified"

**Cause:** Trial account can only send to verified numbers

**Fix:**
1. Go to Twilio Console ‚Üí Verified Caller IDs
2. Verify the emergency contact phone number
3. Or upgrade your Twilio account to send to any number

### Issue: "Unable to create record: Authenticate"

**Cause:** Invalid Account SID or Auth Token

**Fix:**
1. Double-check credentials in Twilio Console
2. Make sure you copied them correctly (no extra spaces)
3. Regenerate Auth Token if needed (in Twilio Console)

### Issue: SMS not received

**Possible causes:**
1. **Check Twilio Console Logs**:
   - Go to **Monitor** ‚Üí **Logs** ‚Üí **Messaging**
   - See detailed delivery status

2. **Phone number format**:
   - Must include `+` and country code
   - Example: `+14085693812` (not `4085693812`)

3. **Carrier blocking**:
   - Some carriers block SMS from trial accounts
   - Try a different phone number or upgrade Twilio account

4. **Trial credit exhausted**:
   - Check **Billing** in Twilio Console
   - Add more credit if needed
